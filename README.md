TRCApp is a mobile application designed for users to register and submit document applications conveniently. Users can create an account, log in, and upload a photo for document registration. They can choose between a passport, ID card, or residence card and complete the application process.

The app provides a structured submission process, where users fill out the required details, select a preferred submission date on the Submit2 page, and finalize their application. Additionally, there is an option to choose a payment method for processing fees, though this feature is not yet active.

Users can also manage their account by updating their password and logging in to track their application progress.
